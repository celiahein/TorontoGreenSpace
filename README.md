When apartment hunting in Toronto, I was deciding between places in two nearby neighborhoods, and greenspace in the neighborhood was an important factor to consider.
In this project, I compare green space and urban forest cover between two neighborhoods. 
I make some simplified calculations estimating green space using NDVI from remote sensing data, and I estimate summer tree/leaf cover area using the tree point data from the open data portal from the city of Toronto.
